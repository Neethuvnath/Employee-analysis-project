Overview
This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC Company to extract valuable insights and trends. The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns, capturing details such as team, position, salary, age, and height. The analysis includes preprocessing steps, detailed data analysis, and graphical visualizations to present the findings effectively.



Objectives
1. Preprocess the dataset to ensure data consistency.
2. Analyze and visualize key aspects of employee distribution and metrics.
3. Identify trends, patterns, and correlations to support decision-making.
4. Provide a comprehensive and visually appealing report.

 Dataset Preprocessing

Task:
- Replace inconsistent or missing values in the `Height` column with random values between 150 and 180.
- Ensure all numerical and categorical data are consistent and clean.

Outcome:
- The dataset was successfully preprocessed, ensuring accuracy and reliability for analysis.



 Analysis Tasks

Task 1: Distribution of Employees Across Teams
- Calculated the number of employees in each team.
- Found that the largest team is **Sales**, comprising 35% of the workforce.

Visualization:
A bar chart was created to display the number of employees in each team.

Task 2: Segregation by Position
- Grouped employees based on their job positions.
- Identified that the **Manager** position has the highest count with 50 employees.

Visualization:
A pie chart was used to show the proportion of employees in each position.

Task 3: Predominant Age Group
- Analyzed age data to identify the largest age group.
- Found that employees aged **30-40 years** form the majority.

 Visualization:
A histogram highlighted the distribution of employee ages.

Task 4: Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure
- Aggregated salary data by team and position.
- Discovered that the **IT team** and **Senior Manager** position incur the highest salary expenditures.

Visualization:
- A bar chart for team salary expenditures.
